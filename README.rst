***************************
SiteShield to SecurityGroup
***************************

`ss2sg` is a small script that updates the rules of an AWS Security Group to match the IPs of an Akamai SiteShield.

This project has only just started so it doesn't do anything useful yet. It can only list the Akamai Security Groups.
